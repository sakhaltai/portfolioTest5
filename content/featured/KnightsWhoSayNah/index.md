[Knights Who Say Nah](https://www.knightssaynah.com) contacted my friend and I to make some 'win/lose' scenario videos for their NFT minting minigame. We had never animated anything in Unreal Engine. We made everything from 3D assets to control rigs and FK/IK rigs, animation blueprints, materials, textures, shaders, flipbooks, procedural vfx, particle systems--you name it. We were fairly certain we could make a video game at the end of this one. One of the most challenging and fun projects to date.
