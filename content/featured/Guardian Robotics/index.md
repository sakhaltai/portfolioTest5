An (somewhat dystopian but well executed) elevator pitch motion graphic for [Guardian Robotics](https://www.guardianrobotics.com/) selling their unique system of AI-Enhanced Security/Surveillance Drones. Emphasis on isometric perspective, 3D implemented with Element3D by Video Copilot, and storytelling.
